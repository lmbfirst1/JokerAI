# JokerAI
This is a repo that I am currently working on to implement a Joker engine and a Joker environment that can be used to train Joker agents using Reinforcement Learning. There is also a rule based agent I am writing as a formidable adversary to my learned agents.
## What is Joker?
Joker is a card game commonly played in the country of Georgia and by some in Russia. It is not popular worldwide but has a lot of dedicated fans who even play
online on sites like [this](https://www.jok.ge). Joker is a card game played between four people in which each player must "call" how many hands they think they 
will take at the beginning of each set after a certain amount of cards are dealt to each user. After, each player must battle it out to see who can take the 
amount that they predicted they would. A more detailed description of the Joker card game can be found [here](https://www.pagat.com/exact/joker.html).
